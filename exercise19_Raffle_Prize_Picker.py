# 🏆 Raffle Prize Picker — Challenge Steps
#
# 1. Ask how many people are entering the raffle (at least 3 names).
# 2. Use a loop to collect their names into a list.
# 3. Ask for exactly 3 prize names (in order) and store them in a list.
# 4. Randomly pick 3 different winners from the participant list.
# 5. Print out who wins which prize and make sure the final one
#    is clearly marked as the Grand Prize. 🏆
#
# Hint: Use loops, lists, and a tool that picks random items without repeats.
